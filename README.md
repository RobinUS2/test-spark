# run locally
docker run -it apache/spark-py /opt/spark/bin/pyspark

# build and run in one go
docker run --rm -it $(docker build -q .)

## Usage

### Data Setup
```bash
./fetch_test_data.sh    # Download test data from GitHub repository
```

### Database Operations  
```bash
./setup_db.sh sqlite    # Configure for local SQLite usage
./copy_docker_db_to_local.sh  # Copy database from Docker container
./export.sh             # Export database tables to CSV files
```

Simple SQLite for now, given the filesize, switching to postgres would be simple

## Architecture
Local docker setup for portability, yet simplicity. Could've done something full cloud / docker compose, but given the data set size and time constraints would like to keep it relatively simple, yet prepare for later scale increase; hence Spark as distributed processing framework. Chose language and frameworks based on some research and Rockstars commonly used techniques to try this out, learn and show the case in the most relevant context. 

Sqlalchemy for DB connection with pandas. Into a local SQLite given the amount of data again, yet a configuration tool to be able to switch to more persistent and scalable Postgresin a production (cloud) environment. 

Implemented the dual layer image lookup with caching via database (to reduce API calls, in production might want something like redis instead of SQL for caching; albeit easier to debug now, hence keeping that). 

## Image fetching
Via lastFm to MusicBrainz (LastFm stopped exposing images), bit of a little nightmare, but works here and there.
```
🌐 Fetching for 'Creed' (cache key: 'Creed')
🌐 Fetching from Last.fm API for artist: Creed (cache key: Creed)
🔍 Last.fm API fields for 'Creed': ['name', 'mbid', 'url', 'image', 'streamable', 'ontour', 'stats', 'similar', 'tags', 'bio']
🎵 Found MBID for 'Creed': 4b1a830b-0a1f-42e5-b8d5-1d6743912e99
🎨 Found MusicBrainz image for MBID 4b1a830b-0a1f-42e5-b8d5-1d6743912e99: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Redirect/file/File:Creed_salt_lake_city.jpg
```

## Other things
Simple structured logger implemented.


## Todos
- @todo check output for errors/warnings
- @Todo remove lastfm api key into os env
- @todo more explanation on what and why
- @todo check if logical split versus regex in py vs pandas for cleaning? not entirely sure sound like should be pandas
- @todo check final files for mess
- @todo cleanup __pycache__ folder in git
- @todo final clean + push into RS repo

## To make it more production ready
- @todo connect to gcp spark cluster + postgres maybe if time allows?
- @todo connect to postgres
- @todo setup (github) CI/CD (local stuff all should be fine)
